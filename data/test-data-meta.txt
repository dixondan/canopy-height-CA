Go to the data repository https://osf.io/7xz28/

In the folder height-labels/testing you will find the 1,000 test images at 3 m resolution and 128 X 128 pixels. There are two bands:

band 1: observed canopy height in meters from aerial lidar
band 2: predicted canopy height in meters from ST-CNN (PlanetScope + Sentinel1 + solar layers) in the primary model 

The locations of test scenes are in the shapefile height-labels/meta/test-quadrants-n250.shp

The naming convention of the file is siteid-year-sub1-sub2 where
   - site id is a string and number identifying that scene or quadrant
   - year is the year of planetscope imagery used for prediction
   - sub1 is the index identifier within a grid (0 to 15)
   - sub2 is the index identifier within a scene to define quadrants (0 to 3)
